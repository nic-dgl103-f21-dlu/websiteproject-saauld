        <h2>Ascent Physiotherapy Webpage Critique</h2>
    <p> <b> Below we'll be critiquing the <a href="https://ascentphysiotherapy.com/news.html" style="color: white;">Ascent Physiotherapy Website. </a> </b></p>
        
        <h3> Landing Page</h3>
        One of the main things I noticed about the website was its poor user accessibility, image relevancy, and navigation bar style. For example, as seen in Figure 1 below, the page does not fold when the user collapses the page to half-size, and is not mobile friendly. 
        Additionally, the photo of the eagle does not seem relevant to their business goals, and the navigation bar is very outdated and underwhelming. Personally, I think the navigation bar could have been improved by reducing the amount of options to 5, and utilizing a consistant, lower-case font in white or black, like a sans serif. Removing the borders in between navigation options would make it less 2003-esque. As well, including modernized buttons for their social media pages along with small and minimal buttons for their bookings and contact would make this header much more attractive and modernized. Lastly, including blocks that display recent successes, products/services they offer, benefits of working with them, and ways to contact the organization on the landing page would be much more beneficial and attractive to the user.

        <img src="images/1.png"
        alt="Figure 1. Landing page and navigation bar for Ascent Physiotherapy"
        width="500">
        <figcaption><b> Figure 1. Landing page and navigation bar for Ascent Physiotherapy. </b></figcaption></figure>  <!-- main page photo with figure caption-->

        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        </p> Next, we'll look at the only block included on their landing page, which is their mission statement (figure 2). Granted it is below a authentic group photo of their team, the photo looks quite staged and slightly uncomfortable. This could build distrust with the users. The mission statement, being in a very cold font, is also below a very bold and sharp title, perhaps in a Times New Roman font. This, being the only thing on the landing page other than their staff photo and short description of services, makes their work quite underwhelming and confusing for the user to want to buy or contact them for services.

        <figure>
        <img src="images/2.png"
        alt="Figure 2. Stand alone landing page block."
        width="500">
        <figcaption><b> Figure 2. Stand alone landing page block. </b></figcaption></figure>

        <h3>Services</h3>
    <p> In their 'Products & Services' tab, you will find another very underwhelming page, with plain and long text, and no photos blocks. This, in my opinion, would discourage me from wanting to purchase their services, or take the time to read what they have to offer. Here, I feel that the use of quality and relevant images, a consistant and neutral colour scheme for the background, along with visual hierarchy would make this section much more successful. For example, in following the web design tips below, this page would be much more enhanced:
    </p>
        
        <figure>
        <img src="images/4.png"
        alt="Figure 3. Stand alone landing page block."
        width="500">
        <figcaption><b> Figure 3. Stand alone landing page block. </b></figcaption></figure>

        <h3>Web Links</h3>
        <p> Lastly, Ascent Physiotherapy includes a 'Web Links' tab in their navigation bar, which can be seen in Figure 4 below. This page is very confusing, as it displays 7 random hyperlinks to web pages in BC, which at first, the user might ask why they are listed there. This page could be enhanced with the use of photos, buttons for links, and inviting, and short discriptions in their place. 
        </p>
            
            <figure>
            <img src="images/5.png"
            alt="Figure 4. Stand alone landing page block."
            width="500">
            <figcaption><b> Figure 4. Stand alone landing page block. </b></figcaption></figure>
    
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <p class="conclusion"> In conclusion, I believe this entire website requires a complete makeover. With an updated header/navigation bar, improved neutral background colour, added photos and blocks, and following the 'good web design' tips, this page would be much more successful, as it appears it is costing them more money than it is making them money to have and or maintain.  </p>
